# Leeds Digital Festival Vote Site - 2011

This site allowed users to [vote for their favourite identity](http://voteforleeds.com)
for the 2011 [Leeds Digital Festival](http://www.leedsdigitalfestival.com) between June - August 2011.

The actual build of the site was done in under a day so there are quite a few slightly rough edges (all
of which won't exist next year, so don't even try it!) - the main reason this site is open source at all
is to simply provide a rare example of the [Jaoss Web Template](https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss-web-template)
out in the open source wild. Thanks kindly to all involved for letting me open source it in the first place.

Don't forget - the actual festival runs all month long during November 2011. [Get involved!](http://www.leedsdigitalfestival.com)
